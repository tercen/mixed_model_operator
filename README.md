# Mixed Model 

## Crosstab to model

Y ==> Response

X ==> Effect under study

Column ==> Fixed effects

Label ==> Random intercept/slope effects

Color ==> Random intercept effects

A crosstab projection is translated into R formula :

```R
Y ~ X + Column + (1 + X | Label) + (1 | Color)
```

The previous model is fitted on each Row factor defined in the crosstab projection.
